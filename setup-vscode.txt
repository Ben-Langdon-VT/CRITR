How I set up raw project in vscode:
create empty folder

install vscode
install dotnet version 7

dotnet new console --framework net7.0
dotnet add package DocumentFormat.OpenXml
dotnet add package Serilog
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.Console

reload vscode, maybe support for this in the window somewhere but i just close and reopen the application

How you should setup this project in vscode:
install vscode
install dotnet version 7
clone this repository to target folder
reload vscode

run by typing dotnet run into console while project folder is open (folder with .csproj)
